# Iris Dataset Classifier

## Description
This repository focuses on predicting the class of irises using logistic regression and naive Bayes classifier implemented from scratch, without making use of any library functions. The Iris dataset is a well-known dataset in machine learning and consists of measurements of four features (sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width) of 150 iris flowers from three different species (setosa, versicolor, and virginica). The objective is to develop classifiers that can accurately predict the species of an iris based on its feature measurements.

## Dataset
The Iris dataset is a popular benchmark dataset in machine learning. It is available in the UCI Machine Learning Repository and sklearn.datasets and is widely used for classification tasks. The dataset consists of 150 instances, with each instance representing an iris flower. The features are numerical measurements, and the target variable is the species of the iris.

## Approach
The project involves the following steps:
1. Loading and preprocessing the Iris dataset.
2. Exploratory data analysis to understand the distribution and characteristics of the dataset.
3. Implementing logistic regression and naive Bayes classifier from scratch without using any library functions.
4. Model training and evaluation using appropriate metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
5. Analysis of model performance and comparison of the results of the two classifiers.
6. Visualization of the decision boundaries and data points to understand the classification results.

## Usage
1) Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:
```
git clone https://github.com/kajolshah310/iris_dataset_classifier.git
```
2) Open the iris_classifier.ipynb file in Jupyter Notebook or any other compatible IDE.

3) Install the required packages and dependencies mentioned in the notebook, if necessary.

4) Execute the code and follow along with the implementation of the iris dataset classifiers.

Feel free to modify the code, experiment with different algorithms or techniques, or explore additional approaches to improve the classification accuracy.
